            <img src="Ed Sheeran.webp" alt="Ed Sheeran in white t-shirt looking at the camera" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;float: right;margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm;margin-top: -0.5cm;">
        <p> Ed Christopher Sheeran was born in February 17, 1991 in England. 
            To be more exact, he was born in West Yorkshire and later moved to Suffolk.
            His father was a curator when he was young, and came from an Irish family. His mother is a music teacher, and he does have a brother who is a composer. 
            Clearly, he has a family full of talent. This will be all the information given regarding his family as he is a private person,
            and there is no need for anyone to know the details of his family members out of respect.
            Ed Sheeran started singing when he was four for a local church choir, then started to learn guitar and cello as well. 
            By the time he was in high school, he started to write songs. In 2008, he started at the Academy of Contemporary Music (ACM) to study music,
            but he left that very same year to take a shot at his career instead. Some of his biggest musical influences include Eric Clapton, Eminem, Van Morrison, The Beatles, Slipknot, and Bring Me the Horizon.

    <h2>Music Career</h2>
    <section>  
        <h3 id="Career">Prior to 2011 </h3>
        <article>
        <img src="Loose Change.jpeg" alt="album cover of Ed Sheera's EP Loose Change, artwork with drawings of coins" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;float: right;margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm;margin-top: 1cm; margin-bottom: 1cm;">
        <p> While the mainstream fans know Ed Sheeran for his songs on the main music streaming services, 
            many of his old fans know him through his live shows that he did prior to his rise to fame. 
            Prior to the Academy of Contemporary Music, Ed Sheeran was already recording his first EP at the age of thirteen. There are 20 copies of this in the world, and he has 19 copies.
            Because they were made at such a young age, he said he does not want anyone to have a hold of them. 
            Of course, all it takes is the one copy that he does not have and the advanced digital world to let the whole world full access to the EP.
            By the time he turned seventeen, he was already erforming at small venues. When Ed left ACM in 2008, he went to support another artist and by 2009, he had released another EP called You Need Me.
            On February 28, 2010, he was seventeen at the time, SB.TV posted a video of Ed Sheeran performing the acoustic version of "You Need Me, I Don't Need You" in a recording studio, which is in his first album, "Plus", which was not released until 2011.
            Ed Sheeran has accreditted SB.TV and Jamal Edwards (1990-2022) for his success, as it was the breakthrough moment for him. 
            SB.TV was formed by a small group of team to give different underground artists a chance to shine, such as Ed Sheera, Jessie J, and Rita Ora.
            SB.TV founder, Jamal Edwards, and Ed Sheeran remained close friends until Jamal passed in 2022. 
            After his video was posted on SB.TV, he went on tour with a rapper named Example. 
            Later in the same year of 2010, he released his another independent EP, Loose Change, with featured the hit single "The A Team". 
            (The EP was then re-released later under Assylum/Atlantic Records, with "Let It Out" replacing "The A Team", as it became the lead single in his "Plus" album.) 
            With digital media allowing greater access to music platform, that very same video on SB.TV increased his fan base, and released two more EPs featuring songs that he collaborated with Amy Wadge, who later in the years co-wrote "Thinking Out Loud", and won 2016 Grammy Awards for Song of the Year.
            Ed's career started to expand in 2010 as he was invited to play at Jamie Foxx's club, The Foxxhole. Ed did not know anyone in the area at the time, so Jamie Foxx let him stay at the house during the time.
            With his recognition increasing over the year of 2010, he continued to released another independent EP, No. 5 Collaborations Project, in January of 2011. Every song on this EP was a collaboration with different hip hop artists including Wiley, Ghetts, Devlin, P Money, JME, etc.
            This EP became the first independent record to reach No.2 on Itunes chart without any promotion or big label to back it up. 
            With this momentum, Ed Sheeran put on one free show for fans three months after. However, with over 1,000 fans showed up, Ed decided to put on a total of four different shows to make sure every fan got the same experience. One of the shows was on the street outside the venue after it was closed.
            At the end of that month, he was signed to Assylum Records/Atlantic Records.

        <h3>Time of "+" (Plus) : 2011-2013</h3>
        <article>
            <img src="Plus.png" alt="Album Cover: orange background, semi-transparent photo of Ed Sheeran's face in the background, mathematical symbol plus at the bottom right of album cover" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;float: right;margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm;margin-top: 2cm; margin-bottom: 4cm;"> 
        <p> In April of 2011, Ed performed and introduced "The A Song" on a BBC music show as his debut single.
            Despite it being on "Loose Change", "The A Song" then got introduced to the rest of the world and it took over the charts worldwide.
            He then released "You Need Me, I Don't Need You", "Lego House", and "Drunk", along with their music videos from the album. All of these songs also ended up on the top ten of various music charts worldwide.
            On September 12, 2011, his first full album, "+" (Plus) was released. This album debuted at No.1 on the UK Albums Chart, and became the second best-selling debut album in the UK for 2011.
            In addition, the album was certified platnium six times by the British Phonograpy Industry as well. As a result, Ed Sheeran took home the 2012 Brit Awards for Best Male Solo Artist, and Best Breakthrough Act.
            The hit single, "The A Team", from the album also was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2013 Grammy Awards. Prior to the 2013 Grammy Awards, there was a suggestion that Ed could perform his song during the show.
            However, the suggestion received blacklash from the Grammy association with the reason that he was not high-profile enough to perform. To solve this issue, Elton John offerred to perform with Ed Sheeran on stage.
            Together, they performed his single for the show.
            Aside from working on his own music, Ed Sheeran also co-wrote "Moment" on One Direction debut album in 2011, along with "Little Things" in their album "Take Me Home" in 2012.
            He then continued to co-wrote songs with other artists such as Taylor Swift on "Everything Has Changed" on her Red album and was invited to go on her arenas and stadiums tour in 2013 as a headliner.
            During this period of time, some of his songs such as "Give Me Love" and "I See Fire" were featured on "Vampire Diaries" and "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug".
            He was then nominated for Best New Artist at the 2014 Grammy Awards, but the award was taken home by Sam Smith instead.

            However,to his surprise, "Sing" became his first No.1 single in the UK. Between 2011 (when he released "+") and 2014, he had written 120 songs total, and only 16 made it to the full album.
            With the success of some of the songs from the album, such as "Don't", "Thinking Out Loud", "Photograph", and "Sing", this album took No.1 spot in both US Billboard Top 200 and UK Albums Chart. With this album released, he had his first tour.
            In 2014, Spotify announced that Ed Sheeran was the most streamed artist of the year, and his album "x" was the most streamed album of the year.

            During this period of time between 2014 and 2015, he has received so much recognition and fame came to quickly at an exponential rate that he was starting to struggle mentally.

            <img src="Equals.png" alt="album cover: red background butterflies; black equal sign in the middle" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;float: right;margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm;margin-top: 2cm; margin-bottom: 4cm;">

            Ed had other collabotion projects prior to this, and for Ed, these collaborations project gives him a chance to have fun and work with different people to try different things musically that he would not do on his own music.
            Some of the collaborations on this project include Camila Cabello, Eminem, 50 Cent, Travis Scott, Justin Biebeer, Chris Stapleton, Bruno Mars, etc.
            At the end of the decade, Spotify had named him the second most streaming artist of the decade.
            In December of 2020, he released "Afterglow" as a single after his first child.

        <p> Ed Sheeran is known for his private life, as he does not care for the glamour considering how many couches he had crash on while doing live shows before he was recognized.
            In 2011, Ed Sheeran bought a farm in Suffolk, which is where he was raised. After being in a few private relationships between 2011 and 2015, Ed started his romantic relationship with a childhood friend.
            After three years, they were engaged, and married a year after that. In 2020, they had their first daughter, and the second daughter was bornin 2022.
            During the later time of the pregnancy and after the daughters were borned, Ed made sure to take time off to spend time with his family and to not miss any special moments.
            Ed had expand the farm to accommodate to the growing family while focusing on doing charity work in his hometown. He donated thirteen bags of clothes to St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop, and some of the items were put up for auction to raise more money for the children's hospice.
            He also launched his own music foundation in his hometown to help artists under the age of 18, and donated money to his high school for any necessary items that the school might need.
            During the pandemic time period, Ed created his own charity for Suffolk to donate and raise money for local charities and children's hospital ward in response to COVID-19.

        <h2 id="Why">Why Ed Sheeran?</h2>
        <article>
            <img src="Tour.jpg" alt="photo of Ed Sheeran on tour playing the acoustic guitar, looking at crowd"   style="width: 500px; height: 305px;float: right;margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm;margin-top: 1cm; margin-bottom: 4cm;">
            <p> Many people focus on the physical attractiveness of a celebrity, and while I do not disagree that it is not a factor (unfortunately in this society), I think the reason why I find Ed so endearing is his humbleness. 
                A person can be full of talent, but it's the values and charateristics of a person that holds long-lasting relationships.
                Of course, I do not know him personally, but I find him very down to earth. I attended one of his concerts during the "x" (Multiply) tour and it was the best concert I have attended.
                It was purely a one man show - just him, the guitar, and a loop pedal. He had mentioned that he wanted to keep the ticket pricing as low as he could, so he tickets were less than $100 for extremely good seats, and a little over $100 for the floor section.
                Rather than a concert, it felt like a jam session, with thousands of people singing to every song without any craziness. 
                Even now, he is still putting on small intimate shows to test his new songs and playing unreleased songs.
                I think at the end of the day, he went against all suggestions on how he SHOULD look, and stick with the typical Ed Sheeran attire - t-shirt, jeans, pair of glasses, and his messy ginger hair.
