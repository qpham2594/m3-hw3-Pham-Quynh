## Ranking Before And After Changes ##

Initially when running the report, Accessibility and Best Practices rankings were at 83, with SEO at 92. The issues include the absence of 'alt' for the pictures provided, incorrect ratio for the pictures, and not having enough contrast for the font color with Subtitles. With the changes, both of the rankings went up to 100. As for SEO, the issue was with 'meta' tag, so I added the content description and keywords for 'meta' tag in header, and that made the push to 100 for SEO. Attached below are the screenshots of the report and the SEO findings.
